It might sometimes be complicated for a customer to translate his tastes or purchase intents into words to be typed into a search engine.
That's particularly true for non technical goods such as clothes, fashion or interior design. In those cases, a picture based search engine could improve the user experience by recognizing visual attributes and recommanding similarly looking products.

A few deep learning algorithms were designed to this aim. This presentation proposes a quick review of state of the art visual search algorithms.

Enjoy!
